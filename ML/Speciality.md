## Pointers to remember

### Kinesis Services
- Kinesis Data Stream: create **real-time** machine learning applications data streams, need capacity planning, real-time applications (extra - Storage,Replay, Flink can only read from here)
- Kinesis Data Firehose: **near-real time** data ingestion to S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, Splunk
- Kinesis Data Analytics: real-time ETL / ML algorithms on streams
- Kinesis Video Stream: real-time video stream to create ML applications
- Flink: Managed service for [Apache FlinkÂ®](https://flink.apache.org/) [Apache Kafka Vs. Apache Flink]

Here's a quick summary of all the services we've mentioned:
- Glue Data Catalog & Crawlers: Metadata repositories for schemas and datasets in your account

- ElasticSearch: index for your data, search capability, clickstream analytics
- ElastiCache: data cache technology
- Data Pipelines: Orchestration of ETL jobs between RDS, DynamoDB, S3. Runs on EC2 instances
